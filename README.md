# Multivariate Exploratory Analysis of World University Rankings using K-Means Clustering
Unsupervised Machine Learning using python to classify universities into ten clusters.
Further using PCA's dimensionality reduction to reduce our dimensions to two, for easier data visualisation.
Using parallel coordinate plots to help explain the clusters after applying PCA.
